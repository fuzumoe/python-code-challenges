    "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special type of binary tree that has specific properties, making it efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In a BST:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Node Structure\n",
    "- Each node contains three components:\n",
    "  - A data value.\n",
    "  - A left child (which may be `None` or point to another node).\n",
    "  - A right child (which may be `None` or point to another node).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Properties of a BST\n",
    "- **Left Subtree:** All nodes in the left subtree of a node have values **less than** the value of the current node.\n",
    "- **Right Subtree:** All nodes in the right subtree of a node have values **greater than** the value of the current node.\n",
    "- **No Duplicate Values:** Typically, BSTs do not allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Examples of a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid BST: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    10\n",
    "   /  \\\n",
    "  5    15\n",
    " / \\     \\\n",
    "3   7    18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- For the root node (10), all values in the left subtree (5, 3, 7) are less than 10, and all values in the right subtree (15, 18) are greater than 10.\n",
    "- For node 5, its left child (3) is less than 5, and its right child (7) is greater than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Operations in a BST\n",
    "- **Search:** Start at the root and move left or right depending on whether the value to find is smaller or larger than the current node's value.\n",
    "- **Insertion:** Insert the new value at the correct position, maintaining the BST properties.\n",
    "- **Deletion:** Remove a node while ensuring the tree remains a valid BST, which may involve rearranging the children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Advantages of a BST\n",
    "- Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion with an average time complexity of **O(log n)** for balanced trees.\n",
    "- Allows for ordered traversal (in-order traversal gives sorted order of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Limitations\n",
    "- If the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., a linked list-like structure), the time complexity can degrade to **O(n)** for operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced versions of BSTs, such as **AVL trees** or **Red-Black trees**, address the issue of maintaining balance for optimal performance.\n",

    "# Dynamic Programming Table (dp)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Dynamic Programming Table (dp)** is a two-dimensional array (or list of lists in Python) used to solve problems through dynamic programming. In this context, dynamic programming involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the solution in the table for future reference. The `dp` table helps in efficiently computing the optimal solution by avoiding the need to recompute solutions to overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaking Down the Problem:**\n",
    "   - In dynamic programming, we solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Each subproblem's solution is stored in the `dp` table to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table Structure:**\n",
    "   - The `dp` table typically mirrors the dimensions of the input data. For example, if we are working with a matrix of size `n * m`, the `dp` table will also be of size `n * m`, where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the solution to a subproblem associated with row `i` and column `j` of the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meaning of Each Cell in the `dp` Table:**\n",
    "   - Each entry in the table represents the optimal solution to a subproblem. For example, in the minimum cost path problem, `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum cost to reach cell `(i, j)` from the starting cell `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The `dp` table is initialized with some base cases. These base cases are directly known solutions for the simplest subproblems. For example, in pathfinding problems, `dp[0][0]` might be initialized with the value at `matrix[0][0]`, representing the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Filling the Table:**\n",
    "   - The table is filled using a specific recurrence relation, which defines how to calculate the value of `dp[i][j]` based on previously computed values. For example, to find the minimum cost path to cell `(i, j)`, we may use:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + matrix[i][j]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This means that the minimum cost to reach cell `(i, j)` is the minimum of the cost from the cell above it `(i-1, j)` or the cell to the left of it `(i, j-1)`, plus the cost of the current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extracting the Solution:**\n",
    "   - Once the table is filled, the solution to the original problem is found in a specific cell of the `dp` table. For instance, in the minimum cost path problem, the solution would be in `dp[n-1][m-1]`, representing the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right corner of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use a `dp` Table?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Redundant Calculations:** It prevents solving the same subproblem multiple times by storing the results.\n",
    "- **Improving Efficiency:** By storing intermediate results, dynamic programming can significantly reduce the time complexity of problems with overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "- **Systematic Approach:** It provides a structured way to solve complex problems step by step, using previously computed solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "matrix = [\n",
    " [3, 12, 4],\n",
    " [6,  8, 15],\n",
    " [19, 5, 14]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dp` table might look like this after filling in the minimum cost path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dp = [\n",
    " [3, 15, 19],\n",
    " [9, 17, 32],\n",
    " [28, 22, 36]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, each cell in the `dp` table represents the minimum cost to reach that cell from the top-left cell `(0, 0)`."
